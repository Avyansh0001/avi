My personal site created with [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) & [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), utilising [Lanyard](https://discord.com/invite/UrXF2cfJ7F) and [GitHub](https://api.github.com) API.


## 📚 Credits

This personal website is heavily inspired/built off of [Audun's Personal Website](https://audun.gg).

## 🏷️ Lanyard & 🐈 GitHub API

Firstly, you want to change the API endpoints in `/assets/JS/lanyard.js`, `/assets/JS/github.js` & `/assets/JS/discord.js`.

In those files please change the ending of the API endpoints:

lanyard.js & discord.js files:

```bash
https://api.lanyard.rest/v1/users/<your discord id>
```

Github.js file:

```bash
https://api.github.com/users/<your github username>
```

*Note to use Lanyard API you <strong><u>must</u></strong> join their [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/UrXF2cfJ7F)*

## 👋 Conclusion

Thank you for taking your time to read this README. It would support Audun & Me greatly, if you link our respective websites in the footer area of the website (or anywhere that suits you).
